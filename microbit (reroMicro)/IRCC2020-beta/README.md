# IRCC2020-beta

## Introduction
**International Robotics & Coding Competition (IRCC)** is an annual robotics competition organised by Techtronics. This competiton is open to all students around the globe. Participants are asked to sit for a theory test and solve for 5 problems on the spot (all about BBC micro:bit Board). For more infomation, you may refer to the official website: [https://sites.google.com/intelek.edu.my/ircc2020](https://sites.google.com/intelek.edu.my/ircc2020)

This repo will discuss the solutions to the Live Coding Session of IRCC 2020, category β (Beta) \[Age 13-18]. (There are a few sets of problems, here is one of them.)

## Questions
### Question 1 (5%)
> Programme your micro:bit to do the following: 
> - When button A is pressed, show "IRCC 2020" on LED matrix.

### Question 2 (10%)
> Solve the following equations: (use of calculator is NOT allowed)
>   - A = (132 + 24) / 2
>   - B = (182 - 168) * 5
>
> Then, based on the answer of the equations above, programme your micro:bit to do the following: 
> - When button A is pressed, show the answer of (A+B) on LED matrix.
> - When button B is pressed, show the answer of (A-B) on LED matrix.

### Question 3 (10%)
> Programme your micro:bit to do the following every time it is shaken: 
> - Display a "square" icon on the LED matrix for 2 seconds, then
> - Display a count-down timer of 3 until 0 with an interval of 1-second between each number.

### Question 4 (15%)
> Programme your micro:bit to do the following; 
> - After micro:bit is powered up, show an arrow pointing North on the LED matrix and let it stay lit continuously.
> - Then, When button A is pressed, arrow shown will rotate 90° counter-clockwise relative to the previous orientation.
> - When button B is pressed, arrow shown will rotate 90° clockwise relative to the previous orientation.
>
> Example:
>
> powered up >> Button A (counter-clockwise) >> Button A (counter-clockwise) >> Button B (clockwise).

### Question 5 (20%)
> Programme your micro:bit to do the following: 
> - When button A is pressed, generates a random number within the range of (5 - 9), then show the number on LED matrix (this is number 'X').
> - When button B is pressed, generates a random number within the range of (1 - 4), then show the number on LED matrix (this is number 'Y').
>
> Then, when button A+B is pressed:
>   - Count-down from X until 0 with interval of 500ms between each number.
>   - Display wording of "X + Y = " on LED matrix, followed by the answer of "Z" on the LED matrix for 2 seconds, with "Z" being the answer of the following equation:
>     - Z = X + Y
>   - Then, display "IRCC done", followed by a "happy" icon for 'Z' seconds.
>   - Finally, light up all LEDs on the LED Matrix.
